## Notice
This library is mostly considered deprecated as I have moved away from the 3 ring concept to rather building dedicated packages based on VaraniumSharp directly to provide specific functionality as this provides more flexibility with fewer limitations.
This library is being replaced by libraries such as [VaraniumSharp.DryIoC](https://github.com/NinetailLabs/VaraniumSharp.DryIoc/tree/master/VaraniumSharp.DryIoc) for DryIoC automatic registration.
As additional parts of this library are moved to seperate VaraniumSharp.* libraries, I will post the links here.

Ring 2 library based on VaraniumSharp. 
This library makes use of and extends VaraniumSharp to be a base for other (Ring 3) projects.
Initiator is designed to implement spesific technologies that will make implementing other project simpler.

For a detailed overview of the library see our [documentation](https://ninetaillabs.github.io/VaraniumSharp.Initiator/)
